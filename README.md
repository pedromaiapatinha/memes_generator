Just exploring PIL library to handle images and text


## Pillow
The Python Imaging Library adds image processing capabilities to your Python interpreter.

This library provides extensive file format support, an efficient internal representation, and fairly powerful image processing capabilities.

The core image library is designed for fast access to data stored in a few basic pixel formats. It should provide a solid foundation for a general image processing tool.


## Further Work
* Resize images
* Create logic to always fit text in images
* Make the main function simpler
